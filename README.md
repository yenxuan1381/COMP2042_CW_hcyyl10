## Project Setup

I'm using Java 11.0.2 on eclipse.
```
$user > java --version
openjdk 11.0.2 2019-01-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9, mixed mode)
```

I have tested my program on 2 different Windows devices using Eclipse

To run the game, select Run -> Run Configurations -> Arguments -> 


Add the following line to the VM Arguments:
```
--module-path "/path/to/JavaFX/lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls
```
In my case, the path to my JavaFx library is as follow:
```
--module-path "C:\javafx\javafx-sdk-17.0.1\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls
```


After that, run
- Maven Build (goal: "verify")
- Maven Clean
- Maven Install


Once the Maven Dependencies folder appeared, the program is now ready to be run.


Now, right click the main project and run it as a Java Application. 

If any error occured, try right click the project -> maven -> reload project.

**Game Starts**


## Refactoring
- Organized classes into packages
- Basic Code Maintenance
	- Renamed Variable & Class name to improve readability
	- Improved encapsulation
	- Added Interfaces (Playable interface)
	- broke down large classes (wall & gameboard class is too large)
	- Error Handling (Throws exception, print error message)
- Removed code smells
	- removed duplicated code
	- removed primitive obsession, used enum instead (enum CrackDirection, enum Impact Direction, enum BrickType)
	- Separated Crack Class into its own individual class to adhere the Single Responsibility principle
	- Did not allow crack class to inherit from brick class due to Liskov's Substitution Principle
- Arranged Code into MVC pattern
	- brick
	- ball
	- player
	- wall
	- crack
- Applied some design patterns
	- Level Factory
	- Brick Factory
	- Ball Factory
	- Added Singleton to Player Class
- Added meaningful JUnit tests, testing for the void methods for each class
	- BrickTest
	- BallTest
	- WallTest
	- PlayerTest
	- CrackTest
	- LevelTest
- Converted the project to Maven project to handle dependencies (JUnit & JavaFx)


## Additions
- Added Highscore 
	- Able to save and load the highscore from a txt file
	- When the current score of the player is greater than the highscore, it overwrites the highscore

- Added additional levels
	- The presence of special brick when creating a single brick type level
	- From 4 levels -> 8 levels
	- New brick type: Vibranium Brick, stronger than steel brick (able to crack)
	- When creating single type brick level, there's chance to spawn health brick and special brick, when creating chessboard type level, there's 10% chance to spawn health brick


- Additional Features
	- Cheatmode enabled when special brick is destroyed
	- 2 types of cheatmode
		- 30% chance it increases the speed of the ball
		- 70% chance the ball bounces oddly after impact 
	- Added Username input

	- Added health bricks
		- Add health when health brick is destroyed
	- Additional Info Page created using Java Swing

	- Added choice to choose level in Debug Panel

	- Created a main menu using JavaFx
